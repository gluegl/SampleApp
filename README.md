# SampleApp
Demonstrates the simplest of Rivetz apps. There are just three files here which
are modified from the Android Studio default app.

* [MainActivity.java](./app/src/main/java/com/test/sampleApp/MainActivity.java) - Instantiate a rivet and call _createKey_
* [activity_main.xml](./app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml) - just  a simple UI, nothing Rivetz specific
* [build.gradle](./app/build.gradle) - Include the rivetz stub library so you can import the Rivet class.
